A quiz that allows someone to find out which animal (cat, dog, fox, hamster, horse) they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share result. Generate an image for each animal in a cute cartoon vector style and display it on the result page. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question.

Place the quiz on the home page.

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added in order to implement the quiz, generate the animal images, update the app logo, and change the metadata:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – to place the quiz on the home page and show the result.
2. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app title and description.
3. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate the new app logo.
4. `mini-app/public/cat.png.todo` – to generate the cat image.
5. `mini-app/public/dog.png.todo` – to generate the dog image.
6. `mini-app/public/fox.png.todo` – to generate the fox image.
7. `mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo` – to generate the hamster image.
8. `mini-app/public/horse.png.todo` – to generate the horse image.
9. `mini-app/components/quiz.tsx` – new component that implements the quiz logic, randomizes answers, shows the result, and includes a share button.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes.

I need to add a new component for the quiz and a few image‑generation “todo” files.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for them:

1. `mini-app/components/quiz.tsx` – the quiz logic, randomised answers, result display, and share button.  
2. `mini-app/public/cat.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the cat.  
3. `mini-app/public/dog.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the dog.  
4. `mini-app/public/fox.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the fox.  
5. `mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the hamster.  
6. `mini-app/public/horse.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the horse.  
7. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the new app logo.  

Once those files are added, I’ll provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and `mini-app/app/page.tsx`.

#### apply changes  

I can’t edit any files until you add the ones that need changes to the chat.  
Please add the following files so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

1. `mini-app/components/quiz.tsx` – the quiz component.  
2. `mini-app/public/cat.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the cat.  
3. `mini-app/public/dog.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the dog.  
4. `mini-app/public/fox.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the fox.  
5. `mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the hamster.  
6. `mini-app/public/horse.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the horse.  
7. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – image generation instructions for the new app logo.  

Once those files are added, I’ll supply the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and `mini-app/app/page.tsx`.
